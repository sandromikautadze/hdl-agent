  "planner_output": "SUMMARY:\nThe user wants a hardware module that can compute both addition and division on numeric inputs. The exact operands, data format, interface, and performance goals are not specified, so clarification is needed before a concrete RTL can be drafted.\n\nQUESTIONS:\n1) Should the module support both add and divide operations, or only one of them?\n   Why: Determines the control logic and whether a single datapath or separate units are needed.\n   Example of options: support both with an operation-select signal, implement only add, implement only divide, support both with separate pipelines\n\n2) What numeric format and bit‑width should the operands and result use?\n   Why: Defines the size of adders, multipliers, and shifters and affects precision and resource usage.\n   Example of options: 32‑bit signed integer, 16‑bit fixed‑point (Q8.8), 32‑bit floating‑point, arbitrary user‑defined width\n\n3) How will inputs and outputs be transferred to/from the module (interface style)?\n   Why: Determines ports, handshaking signals, and testbench behavior.\n   Example of options: start/done with two operand registers and one result register, streaming valid/ready for each operand, memory‑mapped registers accessed via AXI‑Lite\n\n4) What latency or throughput requirements exist for the operation?\n   Why: Influences pipeline depth and whether the design targets single‑cycle, multi‑cycle, or deeply pipelined execution.\n   Example of options: single‑cycle result, pipelined with configurable stages, arbitrary latency acceptable\n\n5) Are there any specific constraints such as area, power, or clock‑frequency targets that should shape the implementation?\n   Why: May force a choice between a simple ripple‑carry adder/divider versus a faster multiplier‑based divider, or dictate resource sharing.\n   Example of options: area‑first (smallest possible), speed‑first (fastest possible), balanced, or no constraints (use default)"
